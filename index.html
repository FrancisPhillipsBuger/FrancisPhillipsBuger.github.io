          Jian‑Zhai (Francis) Zhang was born in Miaoli, Taiwan in 2004 and is currently pursuing a B.S. in Engineering and System Science at National Tsing Hua University.  As a research intern under Prof. Shun‑Chi Wu he develops AI‑assisted tools for materials computation and atomic‑scale particle tracking.  Francis co‑founded a student co‑research group exploring neural operators and their applications to phonon transport and disease diagnosis.  His interests span machine learning, inverse design and computational optimization.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Currently</strong> he is focusing on AI‑assisted materials design, image reconstruction and novel optimization algorithms.  When not in the lab he enjoys collaborating with peers on open‑source projects.

        <p>
          Born in 2004 in Miaoli, Taiwan, Francis has always been fascinated by the interplay between hardware and computation.  He is expected to earn his B.S. in Engineering and System Science from National Tsing Hua University in June&nbsp;2026.  From December&nbsp;2024 to May&nbsp;2027 he serves as an undergraduate research intern in the <em>Data Analysis and Interpretation Laboratory</em> under Prof.&nbsp;Shun‑Chi Wu, where he develops AI‑assisted tools for materials computation and design, atomic‑scale particle tracking and structural reconstruction.  In addition to his lab work he co‑founded an independent co‑research group that explores neural operators for solving the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation and ECG‑based disease diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Francis’ academic interests include machine learning, deep learning, inverse design, particle swarm optimization, filter design, and signal as well as image processing.  Outside of research he is committed to open education and has mentored junior students in programming and data analysis.  His long‑term goal is to develop computational frameworks that accelerate materials discovery and integrate physics‑based models with modern AI techniques.
